Juice is a native macOS Application that enables Workspace ONE Administrators to easily manage the lifecycle of Internal macOS Apps in Workspace ONE UEM.

Vastly different from App management from the Apple App Store, native Apps in Workspace ONE typically have a larger overhead in management. Juice simplifies this by streamlining these 4 key processes:

 


App Discovery

Juice currently has an Application Repository of approximately 7500 native macOS applications in its database that an administrator can search and with a few simple clicks can import automatically into the Workspace ONE catalog, ready for deployment.

Application Update Management

Juice can interrogate the existing catalog of native macOS Applications in Workspace ONE UEM and identify any available application updates. If an update to an Application is available in the Juice database, Workspace ONE administrators can select the updated application and automatically upload this to the Workspace ONE UEM Application Catalog.

Bulk Download for Offline Vulnerability Scanning

After nearly 2 years of collaboration with some of our largest customers, weâ€™ve heard a fundamental requirement that Applications must be scanned and validated by their own security teams. Juice allows for a two-stage process where you can download installers in bulk, have your security teams scan the files, and then import these downloaded Apps back into Juice at a later stage to do the upload into Workspace ONE.

Bulk Import and Upload

Prior to Juice, processing and uploading of macOS applications into Workspace ONE needed to be done individually. Now Administrators can scan an existing folder of native macOS Applications and Juice will process the installers, generate the required metadata files, extract the icons and facilitate the bulk upload of apps into the Workspace ONE App Catalog. Better yet, Juice can import your own internal applications, not only those downloaded using Juice, and will scan folders recursively for suitable installers allowing you to import your own local repositories.
